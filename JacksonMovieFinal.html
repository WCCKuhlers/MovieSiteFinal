        <center><h3><dt>Reason for my favorite scene</dt></h3></center>
		<dd>The primary reason for my favorite scene in the movie "IT" being the final fight with
		Pennywise at the end of the movie is that when Pennywise is defeated, he falls into the nearby sewer drain
        and it starts to build up suspense for the next chapter of the movie.</dd>
        <center><h3><dt>Reason for my 2nd favorite scene</dt></h3></center>
		<dd>The reason why my 2nd favorite scene in the movie is the build-up is because the build-up is meant to 
		create a emotional feeling in the audience that makes the audience think "What is going to happen next?"
