		<h3>What is Baby Driver</h3>
			<p>Baby Driver is a Thriller, Action, and Crime movie about a young man named Baby who is 
			roped into working for a crime boss as a getaway driver but meets the love of his life, Deborah, and wants to get out of the business. He is hearing impaired with a condition called tinnitus and uses music to drown out a constant ringing in his ear. He also uses the music to live his life and commit his robberies all while going along with the beat of the music also using it
			to convey his mood.</p><br>

		<h3>Why is it my favorite movie</h3>
		<p>I enjoy it for many reasons. Heres just a few:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>The Choreography is Fantastic.</li><br>
				<li>The Soundtracks.</li><br>
				<li>The Characters.</li><br>
				<li>The Action Packed Scenes</strong></li><br>
			</ul>
<br>
		<h3>Favorite Scenes</h3>
		<p>Some of my favorite scenes are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ARFyrM6gVs">first scene</a> because it 
				establishes the vibe of the movie and is a great attention grabber.</li></strong><br>

				<br><li><strong>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYv2a_VF328">coffee run scene</a> was also a
				great scene because it is so on beat with the music. This is also the first time baby sees Deborah.</li></strong><br>

				<br><li><strong>The last scene I enjoyed is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFXOR2yoWCg">shootout scene</a> 
				 because all of the gunshots and movements are so on queue with the music
				it just makes your think how many times the scene may have needed to be filmed.</li></strong><br>

		<h3>My Favorite Characters</h3>
<img src="BlueBaby.jpeg" height="270" width="360" class="float2">
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Baby</strong></dt>
					<dd>Baby is one of my favorite character because his character progression shows a lot after he sees
					Deborah for the first time and also after he meets her.</dd><br>
				<dt><strong>Deborah</strong></dt>
					<dd>Deborah is one of my favorite characters as well because even after knowing what Baby does it has no
					effect on her feelings for Baby.</dd><br>
				<dt><strong>Buddy</strong></dt>
					<dd>Buddy is another one of my favorite characters because he has such a strong personality all throughout the movie.
					Once darling is killed he begins to lose sight of everything and goes ballistic.</dd>
